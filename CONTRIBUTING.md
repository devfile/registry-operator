## How to Contribute

### Issues

If you spot a problem with the **devfile registry operator**, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/devfile/api/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aarea%2Fregistry).

If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/devfile/api/issues/new/choose). You can tag Devfile Registry Operator related issues with the `/area registry` text in your issue.

### Development

#### First Time Setup

1. Install prerequisites: see [Requirements section in README](README.md#requirements).

2. Fork and clone this repository.

3. Open the folder in the IDE of your choice (VS Code with Go extension, or GoLand is recommended)

#### Build and Run the Operator

The Makefile currently supports both Docker and Podman. To run the proper command replace `<engine>` with either `podman` or `docker` depending on your container engine.

1. Log in to an OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster

2. Run `export IMG=<operator-image>` where `<operator-image>` is the image repository to where you would like to push the image (e.g. `quay.io/user/registry-operator:latest`).

3. Run `make <engine>-build` to build the devfile registry operator.

4. Run `make <engine>-push` to push the devfile registry operator image.

5. (Optional, **docker only**) Run `make docker-buildx` to build and push the devfile registry operator multi-architecture image.

6. Run `make install-cert` to install the cert-manager. (Allow time for these services to spin up before moving on to step 7 & 8).

7. Run `make install` to install the CRDs.

8. Run `make deploy` to deploy the operator.

##### Enabling HTTP/2 on the Webhook Server

By default, http/2 on the webhook server is disabled due to [CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3).

If you want to enable http/2 for the webhook server, build with `ENABLE_WEBHOOK_HTTP2=true make <engine>-build` or with
`ENABLE_WEBHOOK_HTTP2=true make run` if running locally.

##### Using other platforms

If you need to target another platform for container builds, such as Apple silicon, you can use `TARGET_ARCH=<architecture> make <engine>-build`.

For example, to target container build to `arm64` run the following:

```sh
TARGET_ARCH=arm64 make <engine>-build
```

**Note:** Container builds only use `linux` as the operating system as local cluster runtime environments, such as `minikube` environments, run under Linux virtual machines for other operating systems. For example, _Apple silicon_ would just use the `arm64` container build.

For local builds, you can also set the target operating system:

**Apple silicon**

```sh
export TARGET_OS=darwin
export TARGET_ARCH=arm64
make manager
```

**Linux ARM**

```sh
export TARGET_ARCH=arm64
make manager
```

**Windows**

```sh
export TARGET_OS=windows
export TARGET_ARCH=amd64
make manager
```

By default, `amd64` is used for the target architecture and `linux` is used for the target operating system.

### Testing your Changes

All changes delivered to the Devfile Registry Operator are expected to be sufficiently tested. This may include validating that existing tests pass, updating tests, or adding new tests.

#### Unit Tests

The unit tests for this repository are located under the `pkg/` folder and are denoted with the `_test.go` suffix. The tests can be run by running `make test`.

#### Integration Tests

The integration tests for this repository are located under the `tests/integration` folder and contain tests that validate the Operator's functionality when running on an OpenShift cluster.

One of the `oc` or `kubectl` executables must be accessible. If both are present in your path, `oc` will be used, except if you
define the environment variable `K8S_CLI` with the command you prefer to use.

By default, the tests will use the default image for the operator, `quay.io/devfile/registry-operator:next`.

You can use `make <engine>-build` to build your own image, `make <engine>-push` to publish it - Replace `<engine>` with `podman` or `docker`. You will need to have a reference to your newly built image available via the `IMG` environment variable.

<!--
Will need to be updated after the completion of https://github.com/devfile/api/issues/1523
-->

In order for `make test-integration` to properly run you must first ensure your environment is prepared for the operator. The following steps should be done **before** running `make test-integration` and
these commands should be run from the root of the repository where the [`Makefile`](Makefile) is located.

1. Run `make install-cert` and wait for pods in the `cert-manager` namespace to be running before moving to step 2.
2. Run `make install && make deploy` and wait until pods in the `registry-operator-system` namespace are running before proceeding to step 3.
3. Run `make test-integration` or `IMG=<your-operator-image> make test-integration` to run the integration tests.

### Submitting Pull Request

**Note:** All commits must be signed off with the footer:

```
Signed-off-by: First Lastname <email@email.com>
```

You can easily add this footer to your commits by adding `-s` when running `git commit`. When you think the code is ready for review, create a pull request and link the issue associated with it.

Owners of the repository will watch out for new PRs and provide reviews to them.

For each change in the PR, GitHub Actions and OpenShift CI will by default run checks against your changes (linting, unit testing, and integration tests).

If comments have been given in a review, they have to be addressed before merging.

After addressing review comments, don't forget to add a comment in the PR with the reviewer mentioned afterward, so they get notified by Github to provide a re-review.
