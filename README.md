The Devfile Registry operator manages the lifecycle of the following custom resources:
1. [Devfile Registry](DEVFILE_REGISTRY.md)
2. [Devfile Registries List](REGISTRIES_LISTS.md)
3. [Cluster Devfile Registries List](REGISTRIES_LISTS.md)

## Releases

**Minor releases** will be scheduled roughly on a _quarterly basis_ and will include non-feature breaking changes made between release cycles.

**Patch releases** are provided as needed for _critical bug fixes_ and _security patches_, it is **strongly recommended** for users running on the same minor version of the registry operator to update when these releases become available.

Releases are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/devfile/registry-operator/releases) along with bundle entries on [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io) and the OpenShift OperatorHub community catalog.

For more updates on releases, please join our [communication channels](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.2/community#getting-involved).

## Issue Tracking

Issue tracking repo: https://github.com/devfile/api with label area/registry

## Changelog

This repository utilizes Release Notes to track and display changes, a changelog for every release can be found [here](https://github.com/devfile/registry-operator/releases).

## Requirements

Deployment cluster must meet one of the following criteria:

- OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.15.x
- Kubernetes 1.29.x

**Note**: Though full support for OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.16.x is not currently in place, it [includes Kubernetes 1.29.x APIs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/release_notes/ocp-4-16-release-notes.html#ocp-4-16-admin-ack-updating_release-notes) therefore should work in theory.

More on the support of container orchestration systems can be 
found [here](CLUSTER_SUPPORT.md).

Deployments made by the devfile registry operator must *never* target the default namespace due to incompatibility with 
security setups.

### Development

- Go 1.21.x
- Docker / Podman
- Operator SDK 1.28.x

See [Upgrade SDK Version](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/upgrading-sdk-version/) for a guide on updating the Operator SDK. Ensure the Operator SDK version and the version of Kubernetes APIs match each other when updating by checking [CLUSTER_SUPPORT.md](CLUSTER_SUPPORT.md).

## Running the controller in a cluster

Install cert-manager to provision self-signed certificates for the validating webhooks which are used specifically for the `ClusterDevfileRegistriesList` and `DevfileRegistriesList` CRs.  Cert manager needs to be installed in order for the controller manager to start.

```bash
make install-cert
```

The controller can be deployed to a cluster provided you are logged in with cluster-admin credentials:

```bash
make install && make deploy
```

The operator will be installed under the `registry-operator-system` namespace. However, devfile registries can be deployed in any namespace.

## Deploying registry to a cluster

After the operator has been installed to a cluster you can deploy a devfile registry by following [these instructions](DEVFILE_REGISTRY.md).
## Development

The repository contains a Makefile; building and deploying can be configured via the environment variables

## Security

Further information for the devfile organization security policy can be found [here](https://github.com/devfile/api/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Testing

Detailed instructions on how to run tests for the Devfile Registry Operator are found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#testing-your-changes).

### Run operator locally
It's possible to run an instance of the operator locally while communicating with a cluster. 

1. You may need to install the `controller-gen` tool before, used when building the binary:

```bash
make controller-gen
```

2. Build the binary

```bash
make manager
```

3. Deploy the CRDs

```bash
make install
```

4. Run the controller

```bash
make run ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false
```
